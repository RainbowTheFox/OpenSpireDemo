# OpenSpire Demo
A decompilation of Sugary Spire Exhibition Night v1.2.
I'm not affiliated with Big Gnome Studios in any way.

# Requirements
Sugary Spire Exhibition Night (for datafiles)
GameMaker v2023.11 (not sure if it will compile in other versions)

# Compiling it
When opened, import the following extensions:
- [FMODGMS](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GMEXT-FMOD/releases/)
- [Scribble](https://github.com/JujuAdams/scribble/releases/)
- [Gameframe](https://yellowafterlife.itch.io/gamemaker-gameframe) (not required)
Also import the data (lang, sound, gamedata)

If you have Gameframe and imported it, go to obj_screen and flip GAMEFRAME macro to on.

# License?
No license buddy!

Just do the following:
- Credit me is optional but would be great.
- Credit Big Gnome Studio for making Sugary Spire.
- Credit Tour De Pizza for making Pizza Tower.

Any questions, decompilation bugs etc ask me on GameBanana or make a issue.

Anyways, enjoy modding the demo!
